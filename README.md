I've been heavily interested in the idea of a certain aesthetic lately and Glitch is a program I'm developing to allow creation of weird glitchy art. Personally I love this stuff, so I'm thinking that having a program like this would be great for me as an artist and I'm sure many others out there.

Just started, more information coming soon.
